## Advent of Code 2025

This year I will be attempting Advent of Code in **Python**. As always, I am optimising my process for maximum fun and enjoyment, not impressive code. I like to solve the puzzles relatively quickly but will often go back and improve upon a solution once I have the correct answer.

### Daily Setup
Each day I run `.\day.ps1` which is a PowerShell script that sets up a folder for that day's work, and pulls my input file from the website. It uses the current day of the month, or an optional parameter for day number in case I miss a day! It copies a template Python file, and some empty text files for adding test input.

### PowerShell input fetching setup
If you want to use the same PowerShell script, you'll also need a config file called `config.json` containing your session key. You can obtain this from DevTools in your browser of choice, under the Application tab > Cookies there should be a cookie called "session". Copy this into the example config file and rename it `config.json`.
