## Advent of Code 2025

This year I will be attempting Advent of Code in **Python**. As always, I am optimising my process for maximum fun and enjoyment, not impressive code. I like to solve the puzzles relatively quickly but will often go back and improve upon a solution once I have the correct answer.

### Daily Setup
Each day I run `.\day.ps1` which is a PowerShell script that sets up a folder for that day's work, and pulls my input file from the website. It uses the current day of the month, or an optional parameter for day number in case I miss a day! It copies a template Python file, and some empty text files for adding test input.

### Day summary
- Day 1: Counting the number of times a dial points at 0, or crosses the 0 mark, during a sequence of left and right operations.
- Day 2: Checking if IDs are invalid (containing repeated sequences of digits).
- Day 3: Selecting the batteries to switch on to provide maximum joltage to an escalator.
- Day 4: Working out which rolls of paper are accessible to some forklifts.
